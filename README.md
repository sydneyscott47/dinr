Tired of scrolling through a long list of potential places to eat with no way of narrowing down the options? 

Meet dinr, a Tinder-like app for swiping on local restaurants and adding them to a list of matches.

dinr offers a sleek, user-friendly interface that cleanly displays photos and information about nearby restaurants. 

Users can swipe left (pass) or right (match), in which case, the restaurant and its relevant information are added to a list of "matches," or local favorites.

From there, users can click on the restaurant for more information, delete individual restaurants from the list for the sake of process of elimination, or clear the matches list - for a clean slate to start swiping again!

Built with React Native and Expo Development Tools.
